# Red Rising Client Side App
This is the companion application to the <a href="https://github.com/michellelavergne/red-rising-api">Red Rising API</a> that I'm currently building. This app takes a character's name and returns which color faction they belong to. This project is very much a work-in-progress.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

At the moment the app is very bare bones. I uploaded it's companion server to Heroku and created a client side app to request json information and place it into the DOM.

## Optimizations

Like I said, this is a work-in-progress. I definitely want to add some CSS styling and perhaps ask for more information that displays to the DOM when requesting different characters. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project was a very big accomplishment for me. I built the companion server and was able to hook it all up to this client app. Now I want to keep refining these two projects so that they are more visually appealing and more practical.
